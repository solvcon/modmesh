"""
Painter toolbox for the 2D canvas.

A dock-widget tool palette, modeled loosely on a paint program's toolbox.
Selecting a tool sets it on the manager, which routes it to whichever 2D
canvas has focus and re-applies it as focus moves between canvases, so the
single toolbox always drives the focused canvas. It is toggled from the
View > Panels submenu, so it can be closed and reopened at will. The tool
set, order, and default come from the C++ registry (``draw_tool_names`` /
``default_draw_tool_name``); ``TOOL_LABELS`` only maps a tool id to its
button label, so registering a new shape is a C++-side change.
