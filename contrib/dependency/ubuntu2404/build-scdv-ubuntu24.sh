#!/bin/bash
#
# Build solvcon's runtime dependencies from source on Ubuntu 24.04, with no
# dependency on the devenv tool. The per-package build recipes here are inlined
# translations of the scripts under devenv/scripts/build.d/ (zlib, openssl,
# sqlite, python, pybind11, cython, numpy, scipy, qt, pyside6).
#
# 4 sections (BASE, PYTHON, NUMPY, QT) are guarded by the corresponding
# SCDVBUILD_* environment variables.
#
# Before running this script, install the apt prerequisites. The helper
# functions below print the exact commands; copy and run them yourself (the
# script never invokes apt). LLVM_INSTALL_DIR defaults to /usr/lib/llvm-22 (the
# apt llvm-22-dev path); override if needed.
#
# LLVM 22 is the libclang shiboken parses Qt headers with on Ubuntu 24.04 with
# GCC 16: clang-18 is too old (its parser chokes on libstdc++-16).  Override
# LLVM_INSTALL_DIR for another.  The patchelf apt package is the same binary
# the patchelf PyPI wheel ships; either works, the script installs the wheel
# anyway as a safety net.  libreadline is intentionally not listed: Python is
# built with --with-readline=editline, which uses libedit (libedit-dev).
# libmpdec is not packaged on Ubuntu 24.04; Python is built with
# --with-system-libmpdec=no to use its bundled copy.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-scdv-ubuntu24.sh
#       Builds everything (BASE + PYTHON + NUMPY + QT).  The default is "build
#       all" when no SCDVBUILD_* env var is set.  To limit to a single section,
#       set one of SCDVBUILD_BASE/PYTHON/NUMPY/QT=1 and leave the others unset.
#       In addition, SCDVBUILD_ALL=1 works the same as the default invocation.
#       Before any package is built the user is prompted with "Press Enter to
#       start the build, Ctrl-C to abort"; pass --no-confirm to skip.
#   ./build-scdv-ubuntu24.sh --write-activate-only
#       Write only ${SCDV_BASE}/activate and exit.  Useful for refreshing the
#       activation script for an already-built scdv without triggering any
#       build section.
#   ./build-scdv-ubuntu24.sh --skip PKG [--skip PKG ...]
#       Skip a package within whatever sections are otherwise selected.  PKG
#       can be one of: zlib openssl sqlite python pybind11 cython numpy scipy
#       qt pyside6.  The flag accepts a single name, a comma-separated list
#       ("--skip openssl,sqlite"), and may be repeated.  The --skip=PKG form
#       also works.
#   ./build-scdv-ubuntu24.sh --no-confirm
#       Skip the "Press Enter to start the build" prompt that fires after the
#       startup echo block.  Use in non-interactive runs (CI, scripts).
#   ./build-scdv-ubuntu24.sh --print-prefix
#       Print SCDV_PREFIX (the path prefix that SCDV_BASE is derived from)
#       to stdout and exit.  Nothing else is printed and no directories are
#       created, so this is safe to capture: PREFIX=$(./script --print-prefix).
#   ./build-scdv-ubuntu24.sh --print-apt
#       Print the apt prerequisite commands (the BASE/PYTHON/NUMPY section,
#       the QT section, and the LaTeX section for the doc/ pstake PSTricks
#       figures) to stdout and exit.  Nothing is built and no directories are
#       created.  The script never runs apt itself; copy the output, review
#       it, and run it.
#
# Overridable variables (search in the script for their defaults and
# descriptions; not repeating here):
#   Package versions:
#     PYTHON_VERSION: CPython release tag.
#     QT_MAJOR_VER: Qt major.minor version.
#     QT_SUB_VER: Qt patch version.
#     PYSIDE_VERSION: Qt for Python (pyside-setup) source release version.
#
#   Build settings:
#     SCDV_NP: Parallel build jobs.
#     SCDV_PREFIX: Path prefix to SCDV_BASE.
#     SCDV_BASE: Base directory holding the install prefix, including Python
#       and Qt version.
#     SCDV_DLDIR: Directory for downloaded tarballs (real dir or symlink,
#       depending on SCDV_SHARED_DLDIR).
#     SCDV_SHARED_DLDIR: Shared cache for downloaded tarballs across solvcon
#       development environments (scdvs).
